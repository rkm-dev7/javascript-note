Object.assign();
=>In JavaScript, Object.assign() is a method that allows you to create a new object by merging properties from one or more source objects into a target object. 
It works like making a copy of properties from different objects and combining them into a single object.
// Examples
const targetObject = {};  // The empty target object

const sourceObject1 = { name: "John" };
const sourceObject2 = { age: 25 };

const mergedObject = Object.assign(targetObject, sourceObject1, sourceObject2);
console.log(mergedObject);  // { name: "John", age: 25 }
